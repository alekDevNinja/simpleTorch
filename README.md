Simple flashlight app for Andorid

Hi there!
There is no mystery here, this is really just a simple phone flashlight app. :)

You can find the current production version on the Google Play market here -> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.alekdevninja.simpletorch

App is made in plain Java. I've made it mostly to learn the publishing process on the play platform.

If you have any suggestions send me a mail, my current contact address is always in the app description on the market page.

Plans for the future? I'll be looking for a way to not use the camera permission as it scares people away from simple apps like this one. Didn't find a solution for this up to this day (2020.04.24).

Quick preview:

Cheers! :)
